# python-hvac-ir
A library to encode and decode IR codes for HVAC systems.

The scope of this library is to encode and decode representations of IR codes for HVAC systems, _not_ to implement the actual receiving and transmission of infrared codes.

This is currently just a minimum-possible-effort implementation for the author's projects without any desire nor guarantee about code quality and interface stability.

## requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org) (tested on >= 3.5.3)
